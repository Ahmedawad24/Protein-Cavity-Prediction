# Protein-Cavity-Prediction
This project aimed to develop a system that was able to read PDB
"protein Data Bank" protein files and extract its 8 features. The 
objective was achieved using data preprocesing,voxalizing, dataset
creation, and CNN deep learning approach which takes the proteinâ€™s
3D model as input and extracts its features which was considered to
be an appropriate approach for our protein 3D structure and the
extracted features to achieve the result of obtaining the binding site
for the protein.
